# Easy Time
I really enjoy programming and hate having to do redundant or trivial tasks. I'm a student Computer Technician at my university and we have to manually fill our timesheets since we don't have an automated time entry system. Being lazy and a programmer, I thought it'd be a good project to see if I could get Python to record my time for me. When I began this I wasn't quite sure how to use networking with Python so I just used Selenium because it was the easiest thing for me to conceptualize. I feel a little guilty since I believe that Selenium is supposed to be a testing framework and not used as an application. Because of this I plan on switching it to use something else like urllib or requests.
