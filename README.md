# Automated Logging
I'm lazy and I hate doing tedious tasks repeteadly, such as having to log my timesheet for work. We don't have an automated time entry system which means at the end of every two weeks I have to log all of my hours at once. So I decided to make  a program to do it for me. 

## Getting started
To get script onto your local machine, you can run 'git clone https://github.com/KingAkeem/AutoLogging.git'. It will be installed in the current working directory. 

## Prequisites
Please refer to 'requirements.txt'

## Execution
Whenever you need to execute the script you can either run ./path/to/core.py or python /path/to/core.py
