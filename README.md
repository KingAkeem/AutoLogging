# TimeSheet
This is a script to automate logging hours into my timesheet. The script is basically a web-scraping tool that can scrape one site and input the text into fields on another site. As of right now, it's for personal use but I hope to build it to be more robust and usable once it's fully functional. I used selenium to automate the web browsing and I used a lot of the os module components to be able to find the chromedriver location or download it in the case that it doesn't exist.

## Getting started

To get script onto your local machine, you can run 'git clone https://github.com/KingAkeem/AutoLogging.git'. It will be installed in the current working directory. 

## Prequisites

Before running AutoLogging.py, you must install these packages first. These are the instructions for deb:

pip install selenium scandir requests urllib

## Execution

Whenever you need to execute the script you can either run ./path/to/AutoLogging.py or python ./path/to/AutoLogging.py
