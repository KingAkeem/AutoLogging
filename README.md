# TimeSheet
This is a script to automate logging hours into my timesheet. The script is basically a web-scraping tool that can scrape one site and input the text into fields on another site. As of right now, it's for personal use but I hope to build it to be more robust and usable once it's fully functional. I used selenium to automate the web browsing and I used a lot of the os module components to be able to find the chromedriver location or download it in the case that it doesn't exist.
